The term [Depth of Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) is commonly used in photography, which means the depth range in a photo or image that in the acceptably sharp focus. Lights coming out side the field will blur out and becoming the beautiful [bokeh (ボケ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh).

[Anders Hoff](https://inconvergent.net/) wrote [a great article](https://inconvergent.net/2019/depth-of-field/) on how to recreate this natural phenomenon with algorithm and math. Unlike the smooth bokeh effect in photographs, Anders uses the "sampling" approach to generate the beautiful grainy effect. Instead of giving your code directly, Anders shares with his thoughts and guides you to implement it in your ways.

You can get started by following these steps:

- Read [Anders' post](https://inconvergent.net/2019/depth-of-field/) and learn the algorithm
- Challenge your self to implement it without looking into other code, or you can take [my port](https://editor.p5js.org/antfu/sketches/5ZumvQKDK) in p5.js as the starting point
- If you get some extra time, try with different meshes, or follow Anders' [pervious posts](https://inconvergent.net/2019/a-tangle-of-webs/) about how he generates the webs starting with a triangle.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day11](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day11). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!
