# Penrose Tiling

Today's subject of study is a [Penrose Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) sketch by Geraldine Sarmiento. Here is it in [Processing](https://processing.org/examples/penrosetile.html). I like how this sketch captured the essence of Penrose tiling by encoding its rules with a simple symbol system:

```js
class PenroseLSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.axiom = "[X]++[X]++[X]++[X]++[X]";
    this.ruleW = "YF++ZF----XF[-YF----WF]++";
    this.ruleX = "+YF--ZF[---WF--XF]+";
    this.ruleY = "-WF++XF[+++YF++ZF]-";
    this.ruleZ = "--YF++++WF[+ZF++++XF]--XF";
    ...
  }
}
```

These symbols might not make sense now, but hopefully they will after doing today's sketch.

## The Task

The task today is to study how this sketch is made, and make one yourself.

Starting from scratch is a bit too much for one day's task. I'd suggest downloading Processing to play with the sketch & learning how each parameter affects the system. Finally, translate the system into p5.js. A [port](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-penrose-tiles.html) of p5.js is availble as well.

If you have time to go further, I suggest coming up with different rules or implementing a variation of the Penrose Tiling pattern. Have fun tiling!

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day12](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day12). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>

P.S. I can't believe how small the internet is â€” Geraldine is also the author of my favorite OpenStreetMap style, [Watercolor](http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#12/37.7706/-122.3782). Here's [her post](http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#12/37.7706/-122.3782) on it. Check it out!
