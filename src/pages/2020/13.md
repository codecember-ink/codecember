# Connected Particles

Particle System is a technique commonly used in computer graphic for simulating natural phenomenon such as water, fire and fog. I have wanted to dive deeper into particle systems for a long time. So, let's play with particles for this week.

Today's pick is a simple particle system by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock), creator of [D3](https://d3js.org) and founder of [Observable](https://observablehq.com). I believe the original inspiration is Vincent Garreau's [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js), but Mike's sketch omitted the niceties and complexities, capturing the essence of the particle system.

Similar to [Day 1](https://codecember.ink/2020/1), the sketch picked today is mechanically simple but produces a minimalistic & elegant rendering. Let's start simple and work towards the complex.

## The Task

- Play with [particles.js](http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) a little bit
- Play with [Mike's sketch on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/connected-particles-iii)
- Recreate it with p5.js
- Add something new & original :p

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day13](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day13). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
