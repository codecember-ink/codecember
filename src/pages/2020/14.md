# Manhattan Particles

Continuing from yesterday's sketch, let's do some more particles. Today I found a beautiful sketch by Emery Carr that combines [yesterday's sketch](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/connected-particles-iii) and the [Taxicab geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).

## The Task

Let's take a stab at recreating this sketch today. Here are my suggested steps:

- Read a bit about [Taxicab geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)
- Take a look of [the sketch](https://observablehq.com/@emerycarr/manhattan-particles) & play around with it
- Recreate it in p5.js

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day14](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day14). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
