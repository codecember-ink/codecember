# Particle Trails

Movement with time could create a trail. In comform, trails of particles can be created with a surprising simple method - not to clear the canvas on every frame. Continue from [day 13](/2020/13)'s sketch, just remove the cleaning code in the `draw()` method, we can have these:

<sketch-day-15-1 />

Cool, but it may look a bit artificial. We can apply some rules to the particles, for example, following [Anders Hoff](https://inconvergent.net/)'s article [Shepherding Random Numbers](https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-numbers/). Making the initial distribution of the particles on the circumference of a circle we can have this:

<sketch-day-15-2 />

Here is [the code in p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/antfu/sketches/VbM1ovnB3).

## Task

- Add the trail effect to your [day 13](/2020/13) or [day 14](/2020/14)'s sketches.
- Try different methods to generate and move the particles.
- Here's a few directions that come to my mind you can try with:
  - Use [Perlin Noise](/2020/5) we introduced on day 5 to replace the random function.
  - [Anders' random shepherding method](https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-numbers/)
  - Different initial distribution and velocities.
  - Apply forces or gravity to the particles.
  - Add a semitransparent layer on each frame to create the "fading trails" effect.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day15). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
