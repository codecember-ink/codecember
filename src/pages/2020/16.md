# Particle Wave

Today we will learn this beautiful wave motion by [Dave Whyte](https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/post/45513650541/orbiters). I always find [Dave Whyte](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs)'s work so inspiring, and you should definitely check them out.

This is so pleasing to look at, right? And you may think this could be a bit hard to implement that may have some bitter physics or math involved. But don't be scared, let's see the moving path of the particles first:

You will quickly find out that every particle is just moving on a circle with the exact same speed. Each of them has a slightly different offset against each other. And that's it. As the [Exploratorium](https://twitter.com/exploratorium/status/670667375172329472) explains, "Wave motion at the surface of water is made up of small circular motions of parcels of water."

## The Task

- Implement it from scratch if you want to challenge yourself. Here is [my port](https://editor.p5js.org/antfu/sketches/fh358UZsZ) in p5.js.
- Remix with your idea, try different things.
- If you still get some extra time, I'd recommend [Mark McClure](https://observablehq.com/@mcmcclur/water-waves)â€™s wave model with depth as the extended reading. [Dave Whyte](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs) has quite a few awesome work that using wave motions, see if you can implement them as well.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day16](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day16). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!
