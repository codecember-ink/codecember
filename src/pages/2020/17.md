# Frozen Brush

Today's sketch is [Frozen Brush](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/413567) by [Jason Labbe](http://jasonlabbe3d.com/). Jason's use of particles + delaunay triangle creates a beautiful triangulation brushing effect. Hover on the sketch below, and press any key for a different effect!

## The Task

The task today is to recreate this sketch. You can find [Jason's sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/413567) on OpenProcessing. I'd start today by reading a bit about [Delaunay Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) and understanding the movement of the particles. Once you have a good grasp of both, this sketch should be easy to recreate.

If you have extra time, try recreating the [Frozen Brush 2 sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/916227) as well. Even better, create your own visual effects to display the moving particles.

P.S. Jason's sketch is inspired by [Lionel Radisson's sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/385808) â€” we have just explored Lionel's sketch on [Day 10](https://codecember.ink/2020/10)!
