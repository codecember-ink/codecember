# Substrate — Part I

When aksed "*were you able to find time to make art in the startup days of Etsy*" in an interview, Jared Tarbell [responded](https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/8/24/interview-with-generative-artist-jared-tarbell) (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>
No. It went away almost completely. Etsy was definitely a super-full-time gig. Wake up, before I even got dressed I would check some of the site’s stats, respond to people in the forums, and basically work on the site throughout the entire day. In the beginning, I remember sometimes I would have conflicts with some of the other engineers or my other co-founders, Haim Schoppik and Chris Maguire. We’d get into arguments about the best practice or best way forward, and I would also fall back on my Alexa page ranking of Complexification. It was ranked higher than Etsy at that point. So I was thinking, <b>I’ve got this art website that’s outperforming Etsy</b>. I could just go back to this. You guys better get in line. [laughs]

So here's the website, [Complexification](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/). As far as I know, Jared's website is one of the longest-running online gallery hosting generative artwork, and has inspired many famous generative artists such as [Anders Hoff](https://inconvergent.net/generative/) and [Matt DesLauriers](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6nZH71ndVV/).

Among all of Jared's work, I love [Substrate](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/substrate/index.php) the most. The sketch aims to visualize crystals growing on a substrate, but it happens to capture the representation of a growing city as well.

## The Task

We have visited Matt DesLauriers's p5.js demos in [Day 2](https://codecember.ink/2020/2) and [Day 6](https://codecember.ink/2020/6). The last sketch by Matt is an attempt to capture the substrate growing algorithm. Let's recreate that today.

The source code is at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/p5-example-algorithm?path=sketch.js%3A1%3A0). Give it a try to recreate it with [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org)!

In the second part, we'll take a closer look at Jared's original sketch to study how he achieved such a fine texture in the final drawing.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day19). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
