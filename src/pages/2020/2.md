# line ⟷ circle

[Matt DesLauriers](https://www.mattdesl.com) is a Creative Coder & Generative Artist based in London. Matt's work ranges from
[computational form](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/generative-art-with-nodejs-and-canvas), [audio visualization](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/audiograph), [pen plotting](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/pen-plotter-1) and [digital](https://www.behance.net/gallery/64751587/LUMOS-A-Reactive-Light-Sculpture) [installations](https://vimeo.com/317006348). Words fail to describe his art. Go experience them.

Matt not only creates stunning digital art, he also [writes](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com) extensively about his work & process and publishes source code for many of his artwork on [GitHub](http://github.com/mattdesl). If you want to dabble in generative art, his two creative coding courses on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/matt-deslauriers/) are a great start. I have taken [Creative Coding with Canvas & WebGL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/canvas-webgl/) myself and I can recommended it wholeheartedly.

## The Task

I picked today's sketch, [line ⟷ circle](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/p5-example-line-circle?path=sketch.js), from the accompanying [gallery](https://p5-demos.glitch.me/) of Matt's creative coding workshop. I like the idea of thinking of line as a *two-sided polygon* and circle as an *infinity-sided polygon* and Matt's elegant implementation.

The original sketch is on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/p5-example-line-circle?path=sketch.js), but you can also edit it on p5.js editor with [my port](https://editor.p5js.org/octref/sketches/WqUGTmueF). The sketch is reproduced below.

If you want to challenge yourself, I'd suggest not reading the original source code until you have reproduced it. Here's how I would do it:

- Recreate the sketch
- Read & learn from the source code if you are done or if you are stuck
- Tweak the code a little bit to do something different
- Combine my (or your!) idea with the sketch for something new

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day2). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
