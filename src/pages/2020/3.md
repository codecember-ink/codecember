# Unknown Pleasures

> It’s been on t-shirts, it’s been on posters… it’s even been on trainers and babygrows. It’s been paid tribute to, parodied, remixed and remodelled.
> The iconic cover of Joy Division’s 1979 debut album Unknown Pleasures is perhaps the most enduring image of the post-punk era. You’ve probably got a t-shirt of it. Even if you haven’t, you almost certainly own the album in some shape or form.

[Generative Artistry](https://generativeartistry.com) features interactive tutorials and podcast dedicated to generative art. It is made by [Ruth John](https://twitter.com/Rumyra) and [Tim Holman](https://twitter.com/twholman). I have been following [Tim's ~~serious work~~ jokey stuff](https://tholman.com/) for a while. His creation has a magic that always puts a smile on my face. Check out the epic [Elevator.js](https://tholman.com/elevator.js/) if you haven't :p

Hope you didn't spend an hour there. Let's get to the sketch today.

## The Task

Tutorials on Generative Artistry have a really cool feature: as you read & scroll from the top to bottom, the editor to the left updates the source code and the artwork is constructed step-by-step. I really like how this feature decomposes a complex form into incremental transformations on simple shapes, making it easy to understand the logic for creating the form.

Today we are trying to replicate the cover of [Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures), designed by Peter Saville. Generative Artistry itself allows you to tweak the code to fiddle with the form, so, [here you go](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/joy-division/).

The original code is written with pure Canvas API. One suggestion I have is to reimplement it in p5.js. Reimplementation forces you to understand. Another idea is to introduce some animation & interaction into the sketch, which should be easy to do in p5.js.

The sketch is reproduced below.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day3). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
