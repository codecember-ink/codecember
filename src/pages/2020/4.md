# Peter de Jong Attractor

<sketches-day-4 />

Mesmerizing, isn't it?

This is a Peter de Jong attractor. Although you can read more about attractors on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor), you don't have to understand all the mathematical details to draw it. Paul Bourke keeps a great [gallery](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/) of attractors. Here is the page for [Peter de Jong attractors](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/peterdejong/). Take a look!

What's beautiful about attractors is that they can be described succinctly in mathematical formulas. For example, this formula below captures the essence of all Peter de Jong attractors:

```
let xn = Math.sin(a * y) - Math.cos(b * x)
let yn = Math.sin(c * x) - Math.cos(d * y)
```

where

- a/b/c/d are four constants
- `xn` is the next x position
- `yn` is the next y position.

Let's have some fun drawing attractors today.

## The Task

The sketch above is adapted from [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://twitter.com/jashkenas)'s [sketch](https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/mini-dejong-attractor) on Observable. I feel Jeremy needs no introduction — you must have heard about CoffeeScript, Underscore and Backbone. If you are new to the web dev scene, ES6 took inspiration from CoffeeScript and Lodash from Underscore. Nuff said.

[Observable](https://observablehq.com) is a notebook platform for data visualization and web development in general. All cells are reactive — that means you can slide the slider cells to update a, b, c, d and the attractor will be updated to reflect the change. [Try it out](https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/mini-dejong-attractor)!

So, today's task is to recreate the Peter de Jong attractor. Here are my suggested steps:

1. Play with Jeremy's sketch on Observable: https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/mini-dejong-attractor
2. Recreate the sketch in p5.js
3. Pick another atractor from Paul Bourke's [gallery](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/) and draw it

If you have more time, try to add some colors or interactions to your sketch. For example, Pine did a few interactive drawing sketches for his 100-day compform challenge. As the attractor is gradually drawn onto the screen, the user can use shift/ctrl/alt + mouse movement to control various constants. Together with the trick of mapping a/b/c/d to r/g/b/a to create distinct color for each attractor, these sketches allow you to *draw with attractors*.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day4](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day4). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!
