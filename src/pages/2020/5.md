# Perlin Noise

[Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) is a function for generating coherent noise over a space. Coherent noise means that for any two points in the space, the value of the noise function changes smoothly as you move from one point to the other -- unlike random function, there are no discontinuities.

It's developed by [Ken Perlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin) when he was commissioned to generate more realistic textures for the movie [Tron.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron) in the early 1980s. You've probably seen the results in movies such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2, The Lion King, Toy Story and so on. In response to that, Perlin won an Academy Award in technical achievement for this work.

Perlin noise is widely used in computer graphics nowadays which you can see it almost everywhere. I have picked [Manohar Vanga](https://twitter.com/sighack)'s [exploration with Perlin noise flow field](https://sighack.com/post/getting-creative-with-perlin-noise-fields) for today's topic as a good starting point to get you understood Perlin noise. You may also want to check [Manohar Vanga's blog](https://sighack.com/) for his amazing explorations with generative art.

## The Task

Today's task is to recreate Manohar Vanga's exploration Iteration 1. You don't have to fully understand how Perlin noise works to finish today's task. If you are using p5.js, it's already embedded as the [`noise()` function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise). Otherwise, there are also quite many libraries out there that you can use (e.g. [`simplex-noise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplex-noise)).

To start the task, here are some steps I'd recommend:

- Read [Manohar Vanga's article](https://sighack.com/post/getting-creative-with-perlin-noise-fields) about his thoughts on iterating those ideas
- Recreate the first iteration in p5.js
- If you have more time, you can continue recreating his following iterations or try something different

Manohar Vanga's code is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), which is the interpretation base of p5.js. Ideas in them are pretty similar and you should be able to understand them without too much effort. In case you want to have p5.js code as a reference, I made some reproductions in p5.js editor: [Perlin Noise Field](https://editor.p5js.org/antfu/sketches/sbq-u9HZq) | [Iteration 1](https://editor.p5js.org/antfu/sketches/KSVvsgQ7S).
