# Rings

Continuing from Day 2, let's do another one from [Matt's p5 gallery](https://p5-demos.glitch.me):

<sketch-day-6 />

## The Task

Matt's original sketch is done in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/p5-example-rings). If you prefer p5.js editor, here's [my port](https://editor.p5js.org/octref/sketches/ebSO0mvSk).

Here are some suggested directions for explorations:

- Play with each arc's color/thickness
- Establish some relationship between inner/outer arcs

I picked today's sketch as it reminds me of a 100-day graphic design project by [Jessica Svendsen](https://jessicasvendsen.com). She created [100 variations](http://blog.iso50.com/23367/100-days-of-josef-muller-brockmann/) of Josef Müller-Brockmann's classic poster for a Beethoven program at the Zurich Tonhalle:

Another adaptation is Jon Yablonski's [Swiss in CSS](https://swissincss.com) project, where he introduces kinetics to the [static poster](https://swissincss.com/zurich-tonhalle-beethoven):

One advantage of computational form in digial media is its kinetics & interactivity. See if you can create something that is not possible on the paper medium.
