# Time loop

[tixy.land](https://twitter.com/aemkei/status/1323399877611708416) is a minimalistic creative coding environment by [@aemkei](https://twitter.com/aemkei). The idea is so simple that it can be explained in a [single tweet](https://twitter.com/aemkei/status/1323399877611708416).

It reminds me of work by [Étienne Jacob](https://twitter.com/etiennejcb), who creates gifs that bring you into infinite loops. Étienne post his work in his tumblr, [necessary disorder](https://necessary-disorder.tumblr.com). 

Recently Étienne started a new website to share techniques he uses to create the infinite loops. I have had fun playing with this technique, so I picked it as today's sketch to recreate:

## The Task

In its essence, tixy.land is a periodic function that takes time, index and xy positions as input, and outputs dots of different radiuses or colors. I find it fascinating that [a tutorial by Étienne](https://bleuje.github.io/tutorial2/) happens to capture that essence, and his sketch above could serve as a starting point for re-implementing tixy.land.

Your task today is to:

- Read the [tutorial](https://bleuje.github.io/tutorial2/) by Étienne
- Recreate the sketch above
- Recreate the cover gif on tixy.land by tweaking the sketch
- If you still have extra time, try to take Étienne's tutorial or the tixy.land idea to a different direction

Here's [my port](https://editor.p5js.org/octref/sketches/O0csGeOT4) of Étienne's processing sketch to p5.js. You can use it as a starting point if you are having problems recreating the sketch in the tutorial, but you can [port processing sketches to p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Processing-transition) easily by yourself as well.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day7](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day7). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
