# Bao Bao Triangles

When I was reading the [triangular mesh](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/triangular-mesh/) tutorial on Generative Artistry, I was reminded of the famous [Bao Bao bag](https://www.isseymiyake.com/en/brands/baobao) by Issey Miyake:

One difference between them is that the triangular mesh uses random triangle offsets and random colors, whereas in a real-world design we seldom see complete randomness. That's where noises, such as the [Perlin noise introduced in day 5](https://codecember.ink/2020/5), can come useful.

## The Task

Below are two triangular meshes with complete randomness and with Perlin noise. As you can see, the image generated with Perlin noise features smoother triangle offsets and color shifts.

Follow Generative Artistry's [tutorial](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/triangular-mesh/) to recreate both, and then recreate a Bao Bao bag with code. You can use my [p5.js port](https://editor.p5js.org/octref/sketches/tnsLNrUdD) as a starting point.
