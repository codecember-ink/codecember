# Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a fascinatingly simple system, designed by British mathematician John Conway in 1970.

With four rules that mimic human life in aggregate, it can give birth to quite complex patterns and shapes.

## The Task

The task today is to study & to recreate Game of Life in p5.js. You can refer to the rules on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and use this [p5.js sketch](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-game-of-life.html) as a starting point. Here's is an idea. For his 100 day challenge, Pine did a [Game of Life with colors](https://100.matsu.io/23). The system begins with a few cells of simple colors, and as the system evolves, each new cell following the reproduction rule — *any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction* — gains a new color by blending the surrounding 3 colors. Another idea is to give the game a new dimension.

When we began Codecember, we weren't very clear what this month-long challenge would lead to. But as we continue to write the prompts, a pattern emerged. We illustrate a simple idea everyday and you take the idea further on the dimensions of space, time, color or texture, eventually making it *your idea* in the process of recreation and remixing. Have fun playing with the idea and see you tomorrow.

When you are all done, post your work on Twitter with the hashtag [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) and [#day9](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day9). **Remember to include a link to the source code**, so others can learn from your creation. We look forward to seeing your sketch!

Yours, <br>
