Hi there,

We are [Pine](https://twitter.com/octref) & [Anthony](https://twitter.com/antfu7). Codecember is an invitation to learn and create compform (computation form), one sketch a day, throughout December, 2020. We are both doing 100-day compform challenges ([Pine's gallery](https://100.matsu.io), [Anthony's gallery](https://100.antfu.me)) and we would love to share the journey with you.

We started our 100-day challenges as we wanted to **learn** creative coding while having **fun**. That's why we decided to use the name _compform_ instead of <s>generative art</s>. Art is such a serious topic & we just want to do some <span class="comic">doodlez</span>, which, according to [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Doodlez), could be your best creation ever!

OK, count you in. Here are the (pretty lax) rules:

*   We'll give you a prompt every day that includes an artwork, its source code and a blurb
*   One sketch a day (you can be late, we both have been late)
*   Post your artwork on Twitter with the [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) tag and a day tag such as [#day1](https://twitter.com/hashtag/day1)
*   Link to the source code, so others can learn & remix (GitHub/CodeSandbox/Codepen/Glitch/whatever)

You might say, "how do I do the sketch though? I haven't done much creative coding whatsoever."  
Or you are worried: "I'm kinda busy and only have 30 minutes everyday. Can I still do it?"

That's ok! We both don't have much experience in creative coding before and we are busy as well. Unlike other challenges such as [Inktober](https://inktober.com) or [Codevember](http://codevember.xyz), Codecember doesn't demand too much from you. Everyday, we'll post an inspirational sketch **with its source code** as the prompt, and your job is to understand, recreate and remix it. The least you get out of every day is having **learned** a new compform.

Seriously, just copying the code line by line to understand the logic & tweaking the constants to explore the form are totally fine. Take this as an opportunity for learning and exploration, rather than a serious commitment for "art".

Join us by following our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/codecember_ink). We look forward to seeing you on the [#codecember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecember) hashtag!

Yours,<br>
